A simple program to print Hello World

Hey peeps!

I am a random coder wadering in the world of codes, trying to obtain World Order.
Codes infact are the very essence of GOD-LIKE power. Think about it, you create a simulated environment for your data variables to work in
then you give them algorithms, their conscience I suppose and gosh dont even get me started on AI.
So folks enjoy what you're doing cause its next to Godlyhood!!!!!
